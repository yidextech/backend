# 🧰 Task Manager API

Just a small Node.js + Express REST API to manage some basic tasks. It's all in-memory, no database setup

---

## ✨ What it does

- Add a new task with a title
- See all tasks
- Filter by status (`completed` / `pending`)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Title gets validated (can’t be empty)
